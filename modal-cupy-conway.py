""" CuPy Conway's Game of Life

USAGE

    modal run ./modal-cupy-conway.py

NOTES

    The first attempt was to use `debian_slim` and install `cupy-cuda12x`:

      image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install("cupy-cuda12x")

    However, that resulted in the following error:

      CuPy failed to load libnvrtc.so.12: OSError: libnvrtc.so.12: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory        â”‚

    Then, the offical cuda Docker image was used as outlined in the Modal guide:

        https://modal.com/docs/guide/cuda#for-more-complex-setups-use-an-officially-supported-cuda-image
